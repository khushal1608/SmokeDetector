## Introduction

The smoke detector project aims to provide a reliable and effective solution for detecting smoke and alerting users in the event of a fire. The detector is based on the ionisation principle, which allows it to sense smoke particles at high densities and trigger an alarm.

## Features

- Ionisation-based smoke detection for high-density smoke sensing.
- Loud and distinct alarm system to alert users.
- Compact and easy-to-install design.
- Battery-powered for portability.
- Low-power consumption for longer battery life.

## Installation

To install the smoke detector, follow these steps:

1. Open the casing of the smoke detector by removing the screws.
2. Insert the batteries into the battery compartment, following the polarity markings.
3. Close the casing and tighten the screws securely.

## Usage

To use the smoke detector:

1. Mount the smoke detector on a suitable wall or ceiling location, preferably near areas prone to smoke or fire.
2. Make sure the detector is properly secured and positioned according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Test the smoke detector by pressing the test button or using a smoke source (e.g., a smoke canister) at a safe distance.
4. If smoke is detected, the alarm will activate, providing an audible warning.
5. In the event of an alarm, evacuate the premises and contact emergency services.
